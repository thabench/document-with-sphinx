What Is Sphinx?
===============

**Sphinx** is a documentation generator primarily used for Python projects.
It converts plain-text files into rich documentation formats such as HTML and PDF.

Common use cases include:

- Python library API documentation
- Developer guides and tutorials
- Internal engineering documentation
- Versioned public documentation (Read the Docs)

Sphinx is ideal when documentation must stay **close to the source code**.

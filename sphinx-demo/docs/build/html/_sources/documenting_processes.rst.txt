Documenting Processes
===============================
You can also document the processes of how they should be performed within your project or repository.

Here is the example of step-by-step guidance in an ``.rst`` file:

.. code-block:: rst

    Mandatory process
    ----------------------

    #. Import the function
    #. Validate inputs
    #. Handle exceptions

    .. caution::
       Division by zero raises an exception.

And here is how it looks in the built documentation

Mandatory process
----------------------

#. Import the function
#. Validate inputs
#. Handle exceptions

.. caution::
   Division by zero raises an exception.

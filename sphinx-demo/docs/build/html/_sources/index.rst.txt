𓃭 Sphinx Demo 𓃭
=========================

This demo shows how to document Python code or processes in your project/repository
using **Sphinx** and **reStructuredText**.

Sphinx provides a professional documentation workflow that integrates tightly with
Python codebases. While it requires an upfront investment, it pays off for
medium and large projects that value long-term documentation quality.
